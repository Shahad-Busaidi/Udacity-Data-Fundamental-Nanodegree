  - The spreadsheet (Excel or Google Sheets) contains individual tabs for the dataset, calculation of the summary statistics, dashboard for Profit and Loss statement, and Forecasting model with scenarios.

- **Exploration of Summary Statistics**
  - The student can calculate measures of center and spread for quantitative data and interpret them correctly.
  - The student uses appropriate visuals to explore the data and presents findings in an understandable way.

- **Communication Phase**
  - The student avoids making inferential or causal statements when using descriptive statistics.
  - The student chooses the correct analysis or plot for a given data type.

- **Business Metrics**
  - The student correctly uses financial metrics and provides appropriate assumptions for the financial model scenarios.

- **Excel Functions and Modeling**
  - The student demonstrates using various Excel functions and builds a dynamic forecasting model.

### Project Details

**Focus on GICS Sector - Real Estate**
- Analyzed the financial performance of real estate companies from 2013 to 2015 using NYSE data.
- Explored patterns in the distribution of average total revenue and operating expenses across real estate companies.
- Uncovered financial diversity among real estate companies through the spread in average total revenue and operating expenses.

**Planning Ahead**
- Conducted data analysis and created a presentation to share findings.
- Developed a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement, calculating Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for selected companies.
- Created a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case, and Base case) for a chosen company.

### Summary and Conclusions

The project provided deep insights into the financial landscape of real estate companies listed on the NYSE from 2013 to 2015. By analyzing summary statistics, exploring distribution patterns, and forecasting future growth scenarios, valuable information was obtained for strategic decision-making and market anticipation.
