# Data Fundamentals Nanodegree Project 4 Summary

This repository contains a summary of the fourth project completed as part of the Data Fundamentals Nanodegree program by Udacity.

## Project 4: Investigate a Dataset - [Medical No-show appointments (Kaggle, 2016)]
## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset using powerful data analysis libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The goal is to gain insights into factors influencing patient attendance at medical appointments using the "No-show appointments" dataset sourced from Kaggle.

### Course Overview
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebooks
- The Data Analysis Process
- Data Analysis Process - Case Study 1
- Data Analysis Process - Case Study 2
- Programming Workflow for Data Analysis
- Investigate a Dataset

## What do I need to install?

To run the analysis code, you will need:
- Python (3.6 or higher)
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

We recommend installing Anaconda, which includes all the necessary packages and IPython notebook.

## Why this Project?

This project offers an opportunity to apply the data analysis process using real-world data. By utilizing Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, you'll gain valuable skills sought after by employers.

## What will I learn?

After completing the project, you will:
- Understand all steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be able to pose questions and answer them using a given dataset
- Know how to clean and wrangle data for analysis
- Gain experience in communicating analysis results effectively
- Utilize vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas for efficient data analysis
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects for data manipulation
- Create meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib

## Project Details

### Introduction

#### Dataset Description

The dataset titled "No-show appointments" contains information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil, focusing on whether patients attend their appointments. Key columns include:

- PatientId
- AppointmentID
- Gender
- ScheduledDay
- AppointmentDay
- Age
- Neighbourhood
- Scholarship
- Hipertension
- Diabetes
- Alcoholism
- Handicap
- SMS_received
- No-show

### Question(s) for Analysis

The primary research questions for this analysis are:
1. What demographic factors influence appointment attendance?
2. Does the receipt of SMS reminders affect appointment attendance?

## Project Rubric

### Code Functionality

- All code is functional and error-free.
- NumPy arrays and Pandas Series/DataFrames are used appropriately.
- Good coding practices are followed, including the use of functions, meaningful variable names, and com
